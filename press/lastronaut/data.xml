	<description>
	It's time to leave the planet you loved behind.

	The year is 2015 and mankind has created the first sentient machine: a humanoid robot. If we only knew what would happen next, we probably could have saved ourselves. Now we’re abandoning the only planet we’ve ever known.

	Lastronaut is a pixel-packed, adrenaline-fueled dash for your life as you run, jump, dodge and fire your way through the machine army, equipped with an arsenal of human and robotic weapons to cause mayhem with. At dawn, as the rest of humanity lifts off in the distance, it’s your mission to reach the last rocket ship leaving Earth. Your life depends on it.
